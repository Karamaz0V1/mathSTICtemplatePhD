\chapter{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedWork}

Did you read this Dijkstra's paper~\cite{Ref1}?


\chapter{\LaTeX~advices}

We advise you to use the following \LaTeX~packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{glossaries} or \texttt{acro} to use acronyms in your document;
\item \texttt{caption} and \texttt{subcaption} to insert subfigures;
\item \texttt{minted} for code (requires to install \texttt{python-pygments} Linux package)
  and \texttt{algorithm2e} for pseudo-code;
\item \texttt{fancyhdr} to customize the page headers and \texttt{fncychap} to customize the chapter headers;
\item \texttt{mdframed} package, to have \href{https://texblog.org/2015/09/30/fancy-boxes-for-theorem-lemma-and-proof-with-mdframed/}{beautiful boxes}.
\end{itemize}




Pay attention to the source code, there are examples for:
\begin{itemize}
\item local table of contents inside chapters (see \texttt{latinchapter/lucrece.tex} file);
\item clever referencing (with \verb!\Cref! command);
\item separated bibliographies (the general one, and your own publications);
\item clickable link with the \verb!\href! command, as used above for \emph{beautiful boxes}.
\end{itemize}

Finally, a good folder organization is more efficient, such as one folder per chapter.

  
\chapter{A contribution}

Did you know it took twelve years~\cite{Ref2} to Dijkstra to prove
his self-stabilization algorithm discussed in~\Cref{sec:relatedWork}?
%% \Cref command prefix the \ref command with the label type (as Section, Figure)

Well this was our contribution, published in an international conference~\cite{Mycontrib}.
